'''
This file contains the Scene class which has the renderScene() method that
needs to be implemented for the assignment. Look for the tags
#------ Implement <method-name>
to find the location where you need to add code.

This file also contains a basic scene at the end of the file which gets
rendered whenever this file is executed. When starting out you'd find it useful
to simply execute this file. Once you're ready to try other scenes that are in
the ./scenes/ folder you should use A3App.py (see the comments in that file).

    The method renderScene is called once to draw all the pixels of the scene.  For each
    pixel, a ray is cast from the eye position through the location of the pixel on the
    near plane of the frustrum. The closest intersection is then computed by intersecting
    the ray with all the objects of the scene.  From that intersection point, rays are
    casted towards all the lights of the scene.  Based on if the point is exposed to the
    light, the shadow and the diffuse and specular lighting contributions can be computed
    and summed up for all lights.
